This project aims to provide Java developers with a quantitative measure of the health and quality of their projects. By analyzing various code metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, Halstead metrics, class complexity, logical LOC, code churn, clone detection, comment ratio, code smells, coupling, cohesion, and adherence to SOLID design principles, the program generates a comprehensive report to help identify areas for improvement. The tool is designed to assist developers in maintaining clean, efficient, and scalable codebases by providing real-time insights into project quality and streamlining the development process.

## Features

### Complexity (Understanding)

- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Measures the complexity of a program by counting the number of linearly independent paths through the source code.
- **Halstead Metric**: Analyzes the software's volume, difficulty, and effort based on operators and operands in the code.
- **Complexity per Method/Class**: Evaluates the complexity of individual methods or classes to identify areas that might need simplification.

### Maintainability (Ease of Modification)

- **Logical LOC (Lines of Code)**: Measures the number of lines of code that contribute to the logic of the program, excluding comments and blank lines.
- **Churn**: Tracks changes in the code over time to identify unstable or frequently modified areas that may indicate poor maintainability.
- **Code Clone Detection**: Identifies duplicate code segments that could lead to maintenance challenges and bugs.
- **Comment:Code Ratio**: Evaluates the balance between comments and code, which can indicate how well-documented and understandable the code is.

### Design (OOP Structure)

- **SOLID Principles**: Checks the code for adherence to the SOLID design principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion).
- **Coupling (God Methods)**: Measures the degree of coupling between classes or methods, aiming to avoid excessive dependencies that make code harder to modify.
- **Cohesion**: Assesses the cohesion within classes and methods, ensuring that components are logically related and focused on specific tasks.
- **Code Smell Metrics**: Detects "code smells," or patterns in code that suggest possible problems, like large methods, excessive conditionals, or duplicate code.
